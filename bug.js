```javascript
// Example using Tailwind's arbitrary value feature
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-red-500 to-blue-500 h-[var(--my-height)]"></div>
```

This will result in an error if `--my-height` is not defined, causing Tailwind to throw an error during the build process.  The error message may be cryptic or not immediately indicate the cause.

Another potential issue is conflicting custom styles or plugins interfering with Tailwind's CSS generation. This can lead to unexpected behavior, like classes not being applied correctly or CSS properties overriding each other unpredictably.
