# Tailwind CSS Debugging: Arbitrary Values and CSS Conflicts

This repository demonstrates two uncommon error scenarios in Tailwind CSS:

1. **Errors with Arbitrary Value Variables:** Using Tailwind's `var()` feature with undefined variables can cause cryptic build errors.
2. **CSS Conflicts:** Conflicting custom styles or plugins can lead to unexpected behavior and overwrite Tailwind classes.

The `bug.js` file shows examples of these errors, and `bugSolution.js` provides solutions and best practices to avoid them.  The solutions focus on proper variable definition and CSS specificity to manage potential conflicts.
